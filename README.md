Project Name: project-2-stage-4

The following technologies were used:

HTML: For content structure and semantic markup.

CSS3: For styling, layout, responsiveness, and animations.

Flexbox: For layout alignment and spacing.

Transitions and @keyframes animations: For interactive hover effects and animated elements (e.g., pulsating circle).

The final stage of this project focuses on completing the menu, about, and footer sections of a coffee shop webpage using advanced HTML and CSS. The menu section involves presenting drinks and baked goods through well-styled cards, applying consistent typography, spacing, and Flexbox layouts with visual dividers for alignment. In the about section, key shop details are displayed alongside a decorative blue circle positioned with absolute placement and animated using @keyframes to create a pulsating visual effect. The footer section includes social media links, legal disclaimers, and branding, all styled with a CSS gradient background and Inter font, adhering to Figmaâ€™s design specifications. Lastly, the brief calls for CSS transitions to enhance interactivity, including hover effects that fade navigation links, alter button colors, and adjust social link opacity.
